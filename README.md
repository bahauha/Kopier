# Kopier v.0.0.0.5-ALPHA

Kopier is a lightweight utility designed to facilitate the seamless copying of folders from one location to another using the robust functionality of robocopy.

## To-Do List

1. Enhance command support (including cp, adcpmv, rsync, dd, and borg)
2. Implement SSH/SFTP support
3. Design a modern user interface for improved user experience
4. Introduce multithreading capabilities to enhance performance
5. Develop a Windows portable .exe version, prioritizing this as the main focus for now.

Please note that this code is a work in progress, as I am still in the process of learning Python. Suggestions for improvement are welcomed.

Happy coding,
Petar Dimic
