# Kopier v0.0.0.3-ALPHA

Small tool that uses robocopy for now to utilize copy of folder from one location to another.

## To-Do

1. Support for more commands (cp, adcpmv, rsync, dd, more)
2. Support for SSH/SFTP
3. Modern UI
4. Multithreading
5. Support windows portable .exe (this is main focus now)

This code will probably be bad, since I'm still learning python, don't hate, suggest.

Happy hunting, Petar Dimic
